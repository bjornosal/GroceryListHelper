# Grocery List Helper
-- 

Rewrite of the java-application started on in github repo GroceryListGenerator.
Using this application to learn the Ionic framework, together with Typescript and get a good workflow with JSON-files.
Will eventually set up firebase with an easy-to-use backend so I can easily add stuff as Firebase's backend is balls.

##### TODO 
1. Basic setup needed.
    * Get json file with dinners. 
    * Generate x amount of dinners
    * Add groceries from those dinners to list. 
    * On basics page; can be removed later, but for now add items here that are not dinners. 
2. See if there are any open dinner APIs.
    * If not, consider scraping of webpage (that ok?)
    * there are open possibilities.
